PlotTwist is a social app that allows the community to collaborate on writing a short story.

[Todd]

Users can do one of three main things.
1. Create and post an incomplete story
2. Contribute to another user's story in what we call a "Twist"
3. Read the stories and twists


-------------

1. Let's check out the site! Todd's going to share his screen -ND

- show stories/main page
 - lists the most recent stories
- if you click on a story you get all the twists (Desert Planet)
- you can read as much content as you want but to create a story or twist, or to vote on twists, you have to sign-up and login

2. Write a story [login user 2 - cartoonMonkey]
  ["The Hitchhiker's guide to the Universe",
  "Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small, unregarded yellow sun."]

3. Let's write a twist to an existing story! (still user 2) - ND

- I'm going to log as (CartoonMOnkey: user2 - Boy Who Lived)
- clicking on a story takes us to the stories page
- here we can compose a Twist (compose a twist - copy and paste witty text)
  ["The owl turned into Hagrid and professor snape was there too. It turned out that Harry died from his wound after-all.  The End. "]
- [top level twist]

4. Voting on a twist (still user 2 - Tale to Be Continued)

[TODD]

5. The original author can then choose to accept a twist (logout, login as user 3 ) -TD
- you click on the story to see the twists
- if you are the athor you see the accept buttons and you can choose which one you like the best
- the accepted twist is then merged with the original story and all other threads are eliminated and no longer eligible to be accepted

6. Not only can you add a twist to a story but you can also "twist a twist" (still user 3) -TD

- [go to Tale of Two cities add twist to a level one twist (it was the age of wisdom...)]

7. As an author, once you are satisfied with the story you can mark it completed (logout, login as user 1 and use Tale of Two cities) -TD

(login)
 - here a logged in user can vote for their favourite twists and write new ones
