PlotTwist is a social app that allows the community to collaborate on writing a short story.

Users can do one of three things.
1. Create and post an incomplete story
2. Contribute to another user's story in what we call a "Twist"
3. Read the stories and twists

1. Let's check out the site!  

- show stories/main page
 - lists the most recent stories
- if you click on a story you get all the twists
- you can read as much content as you want but to create a story or twist, or to vote on twists, you have to sign-up and login

2. Let's write a twist to an existing story! (login user 2)

- I'm going to log as (CartoonMOnkey: user2 - boy who lived)
- clicking on a story takes us to the stories page 
- here we can compose a Twist (compose a twist - copy and paste witty text)
- [top level twist]

3. The original author can then choose to accept a twist (logout, login as user 3 )

- you click on the story to see the twists
- if you are the athor you see the accept buttons and you can choose which one you like the best
- the accepted twist is then merged with the original story and all other threads are eliminated and no longer eligible to be accepted

4. Not only can you add a twist to a story but you can also "twist a twist" (still user 3)

- [go to Tale of Two cities add twist to a level one twist (it was the age of wisdom...)]

5. As an author, once you are satisfied with the story you can mark it completed (logout, login as user 1 and use Tale of Two cities)

 - here a logged in user can vote for their favourite twists and write new ones
